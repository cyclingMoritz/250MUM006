            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project investigates the potential of permanent inductive loop bicycle counters by analyzing traffic data collected in Barcelona from 2017 to 2023. 
            It explores seasonal patterns, daily trends, and anomalies while emphasizing data cleaning and imputation techniques to improve data reliability. </p>

            <h2>Visualization 1: Long-Term Trends</h2>
            <p>This visualization highlights the long-term traffic trends, including a sharp decline during the COVID-19 lockdown and subsequent recovery. 
            The data reflects yearly and overall cycling activity changes over time.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 2: Error Analysis and Data Quality Assessment</h2>
            <p>In the Figure 2 we can observe the evolution in the number of observations as well as the presence of errors of varying seriousness. 
                The number of observations increases overtime, with some notable drops that can last various days or may not recover at all.</p>
            <p>Focusing on the categories of observations, we can see that most of the data falls under the "Valid" category, followed by "Invalid" and "Unknown" as shown in Table 1Table 2.
                The "Valid" category accounts for most observations (89.9%) and is present on almost every day (99.9%). In contrast, "Unknown" errors are relatively rare, making up only 2.5% of the total,
                and occur on fewer days (15.1%). The "Partial" category, though less frequent overall (1.4%), appears on most days (99.1%) but never exceeds 25.5% of the daily observations.
                "Invalid" observations are more common than "Unknown" (6.1%) and occur on nearly as many days as "Valid," with a significant maximum daily ratio of 61.6%.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 3: Data Anomalies</h2>
            <p>This visualization presents anomalies detected in the data, such as unusually high or low counts. 
            It also demonstrates how data cleaning enhanced the accuracy of the analysis.</p>
